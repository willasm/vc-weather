# Macro Definitions
These strings in your templates will be replaced with the relevant weather information. All macros are wrapped with the percent character, eg. %datetime% will be replaced with 20:45:00

#### Measurement Abreviations
- F - Fahrenheit
- C - Celcius
- mm - Millimeters
- cm - Centimeters
- mph - Miles Per Hour
- kph - Kilometers
- mb - Millibars
- W/m2 - Watt per square metre
- MJ/m2 - Millijoule per square metre
- Note: Unix times could be useful in scripts

> Please note that all available macros can be used in any of the templates. Even ones for different locations.
> 
> For example...
> 
> `%address%:` `%temp%¬∞`, `%l2address%:` `%l2temp¬∞%`, `%l3address%:` `l3%temp¬∞%`
> 
>  would return...
> 
> `Edmonton: 28¬∞, London: 30¬∞, Chicago: 31¬∞`

## Macros for Additional Locations
The macros for the 4 optional additional locations are the same as all the previous macros (less the current weather and current date and time) with just one minor change. You just need to prepend to the macros with...

- `l2` for the first additional location (short for location 2)
- `l3` for the second additional location (short for location 3)
- `l4` for the third additional location (short for location 4)
- `l5` for the fourth additional location (short for location 5)

For example, `%tempmax-today%` represents todays high for your primary location. `%l2tempmax-today%` would be todays high for your first additional location. `%address%` would be your cities name for your primary location and `%l3address%` would be the city name for your second additional location.

> Note that the current weather as well as the current date and time do not have l2 to l5 macro variants as they are not needed for any of the additional locations.
