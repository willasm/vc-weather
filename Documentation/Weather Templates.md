## TIPS
#### Use for More Than Just Weather
If you have a piece of text that you regularly enter into your notes you can define it as one of the 8 templates, and insert it into your code whenever needed. Optionally you could assign a hotkey to the command to insert that template. This is even more useful if you find you are only using 1 or 2 of the 8 templates to begin with.

#### Edit Your Templates in Obsidian
To ensure your template inserts properly formatted text, edit it within Obsidian, then copy and paste it into the settings. The text areas used in Obsidians settings can be difficult to edit. A good example is the default template 8 which inserts the weather in a table. Trying to edit a table in the settings text area is very difficult at best and is very likly to not render properly.
