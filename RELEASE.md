## [0.2.5] 2024-11-03
- Changed: Inserting template from command palette has been improved
  - It was inserting `%weather1%` to `%weather8%` and then waiting for the template expansion
  - Now inserts the fully formatted expanded template instead
  - The insertion is now instant without the slight delay

For a full list of changes, please see the projects [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) file.

I hope you enjoy using the Extension, and if you find any bugs, or would like to see a certain feature added, please feel free to contact me.

Enjoy! William
